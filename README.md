## ðŸ¤– GPT Writing Tools

GPT Writing Tools is a minimalist browser extension created to streamline writing tasks by integrating OpenAI's GPT API into the context menu (right-click) of your web browser. It was born out of the need for a no-frills solution that leverages personal OpenAI API keys, offering a simple yet powerful tool for text generation, rewriting, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Context Menu Integration**: Access custom GPT prompts with a simple right-click on any text field.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Set your own GPT prompts through a user-friendly control panel.
- **API Key Management**: Easily input and update your OpenAI API key to use the extension seamlessly.
- **Boost Productivity**: Save time on common writing tasks like drafting, editing, and brainstorming ideas.

This project also serves as an experiment in using Claude 3.5 for software development, with the initial bootstrap and 90% of the development coming from a single prompt.

Ideal for content creators, researchers, and professionals looking to enhance their writing workflows with AI.
